# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a 3DS homebrew port of a game I wrote in a custom
game engine I had written in Java for Android.

To build, devkitPro and libctru must be installed.

To play, download the .3dsx file from Releases (should be displayed on the right). It can then be dragged into Citra - if emulating - or placed on an SD card to play on modded 3DS hardware.
